# Python Graph Algorithm Visualizer

The Python Graph Algorithm Visualizer is a powerful tool built with PyQt for the user interface and NetworkX for graph operations. It enables users to visualize and analyze graph algorithms, supporting dataset loading from files and implementing algorithms such as Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Bellman-Ford.

## Features

- **Graph Algorithms:** Implement and visualize various graph algorithms, including:
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm

- **Dataset Loading:** Load graph datasets from files for easy visualization and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the main script to launch the visualizer.

3. **Load a Dataset:**
   - Use the interface to load a graph dataset from a file.

4. **Algorithm Visualization:**
   - Select an algorithm to visualize and observe the step-by-step process.

5. **Graph Analysis:**
   - Gain insights into the algorithms' workings and understand the underlying graph structures.

## Technologies Used
